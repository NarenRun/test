                    Phnom Penh, Cambodia – Proparco is collaborating with the Foreign Trade 
                    Bank of Cambodia (FTB), a long-standing partner of AFD Group, by signing 
                    a $20 million line of credit and a €1.5 million technical assistance grant. 
                    The project aims to improve access to essential water and electricity services 
                    for Cambodian households in peri-urban and rural areas.

                    The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has an objective to have 100% of the 
                    country-wide households connected to clean water and reliable electricity by 
                    2025. In order to achieve this ambitious objective, there are dependencies on 
                    a multitude of private operators to provide access of such essential services 
                    to the population in peri-urban and rural areas. <br>
                    While the water sector in major cities is operated by public companies, small 
                    private operators, the “Small Water Enterprises” (SWEs), are responsible for 
                    water distribution in the rest of the country. Each SWE produces and distributes
                    water and covers between 500 and 20,000 households. These operators are essential,
                    but most of the time they face various challenges and including to get access to 
                    credit. The financing needs of these small private operators are estimated at nearly 
                    $280 million for water and $132.5 million for electricity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    To meet these challenges, Proparco has signed a $20 million long term financing with 
                    Foreign Trade Bank of Cambodia (FTB) together with a €1.5 million technical assistance 
                    grant from the French government. This line of credit to FTB is primarily intended to 
                    support access to financing for small water and electricity enterprises (“Small Water 
                    Enterprises, SWEs, and Rural Electrification Enterprises, REEs”) located in rural and 
                    peri-urban areas of Cambodia. In total, nearly 544,000 people are expected to benefit 
                    from access to improved water and electricity services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project is a continuation of the first phase of AFD’s project to support small-scale 
                    water and electricity operators in Cambodia between 2014 and 2019, which enabled more than 
                    400,000 Cambodian to have an improve access to water and electricity. Overall thanks to the 
                    2 phases of the project, close to 1 million people will get an improved access to such basic services.

                    “FTB is pleased to partner with AFD in Phase 1 and now with PROPARCO in Phase 2. Through this financing 
                    project with the technical assistance to support SWEs and REEs, we will be able to make a significant 
                    positive economic, social and environmental impact. It is also expected that this Phase 2 project will 
                    contribute the government’s objective of having 100% households across the country connected to clean 
                    water and affordable electricity by 2025.”

                    “AFD Group is pleased to continue its support to small-scale water and electricity producers through 
                    financing to FTB. We are looking forward to putting the Group’s synergy to work for small entrepreneurs 
                    in Cambodia. This project is a continuation of the first support provided by AFD in 2014. Now implemented 
                    by Proparco’s teams, this second phase demonstrates the successful cooperation between AFD, Proparco, and FTB. 
                    AFD, as a Group, is delighted to provide an innovative tool in the private sector. Phase 1 enabled 36,000 households 
                    to be connected to a better quality water service and over 26,000 homes to electricity. Phase 2 will scale up and diversify 
                    the impacts.”

                    “Thanks to this fruitful partnership with FTB which involves various stakeholders in the water and electricity sector across 
                    Cambodia, this 20MUSD long term financing combined with a 1.5MEUR technical assistance grant, more than 500,000 people will 
                    have an improved access to clean water and electricity. By facilitating access to better quality water, the project will 
                    contribute to the reduction of the development of health diseases transmitted by water whose prevalence is expected to increase 
                    in the coming years due to climate change. This is a very nice example of how banks can finance adaptation to climate change 
                    alongside access to basic services.”
